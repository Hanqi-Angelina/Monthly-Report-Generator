# Weekly-Reprot-Generator
This is a project used to help deal with the meteorological data. The input will be a csv, and the dew point, vapour pressure, humidex, max, min and average will be calculated, and the calculated data will be output in the csv, while being used to learn about the weather condition and make predictions. The averages, condition and predictions will be output in a txt file.
